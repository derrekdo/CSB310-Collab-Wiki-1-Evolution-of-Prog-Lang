# Evolution of the C++ Programming Language

## Introduction

<img align="right" src="images/stroustrup.jpg" alt="Bjarne Stroustrup Headshot"/> The C++ language begins with Bjarne Stroustrup. In 1979, he worked with the _Simula_ language for his Ph.D. thesis. The particular varaint of _Simula_ that he worked with was _Simula 67_ which is know to be the first language to support the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. This paradigm inspired him to begin work on a language that took everything about the C language and then add classes to the language [1]. It was called, creatively, _C with Classes_ and had 3 goals: 

1. It should be organized with classes and inheritance.
2. It will have little to no performance hit relative to the _C_ language.
3. That it could be used for any application that _C_ could be used (yes even the bad stuff) [2].

In 1983, the _C with Classes_ name was officially changed to _C++_, but it wasn't until 1985, that the first implementation and compiler were released [2]. The compiler, called Cfont, was actually written in _C with Classes_ and additionally translated the compiled _C with Classes_ programs into standard _C_ code [1].

The language did not yet have a formal standardization, but two references were published to aid programmers in its use. _The C++ Programming Language_ in 1985, followed by the _The Annotated C++ Reference Manual_ in 1990. Both of these references influenced the first international standard for C++: ISO/IEC 14882:1998 that arrived in 1998 (informally C++98).[1]

This language took the imperative _C_ language and added classes to it to provide better organization and powerful OOP concepts that continued to evolve.
